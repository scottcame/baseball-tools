### Game Editor

The Game Editor is a J2EE web application that allows users to create and edit [baseball-json](https://github.com/scottcame/baseball-json)
game results files.

Currently the editor is in a very early stage of development.

#### Installation

Build the application with `mvn install` and install `target/baseball-tools.war` into your J2EE servlet container.

We plan to make the application a Spring Boot application eventually.  This will expand the options for installing/running it, both inside and outside
a servlet container.
